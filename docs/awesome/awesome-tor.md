> Awesome Tor is a curated list of resources, tools, and applications related to the Tor network.

> This product is produced independently from the TorÂ® anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.

Tor is a free overlay network for enabling anonymous communication. Built on free and open-source software and more than seven thousand volunteer-operated relays worldwide, users can have their Internet traffic routed via a random path through the network.
