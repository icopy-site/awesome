## Awesome Spark [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) packages and resources.

_Apache Spark is an open-source cluster-computing framework. Originally developed at the [University of California](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/), [Berkeley's AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/), the Spark codebase was later donated to the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/), which has maintained it since. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault-tolerance_  ([Wikipedia 2017](#wikipedia-2017)).

Users of Apache Spark may choose between different the Python, R, Scala and Java programming languages to interface with the Apache Spark APIs.
