> A community-curated list of _awesome_ Plone add-ons.

<!--lint ignore double-link-->
[Plone](https://plone.org) is a open source CMS written in Python with a focus on functionality, customizability and security out of the box.

<!--lint ignore double-link-->
There are over 3000 add-ons for [Plone on PyPi](https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Framework+%3A%3A+Plone) and over 1500 repositories in the [Collective](https://github.com/collective) organization on GitHub. If you want to know if there is already a add-on for Plone that fits your needs, searching for it on GitHub or PyPi can be hard. It's hard to understand which one could be a good solution or not.

This list is intended to fill that gap, and create a shared knowledge about common products and techniques.

For a filterable list of addons aggreating all Plone related packages from PyPi see https://pag.derico.tech.

This list only covers add-ons that work with the latest major versions of Plone (currently 5.2 and 6) and only those that support Python 3.

Plone 6 comes with a new default frontend called Volto, which is written in React and uses `plone.restapi` to communicate with Plone. Volto is very extendable in itself. Checkout the [awesome-volto list](https://github.com/collective/awesome-volto) for add-ons to Volto.
