[Kustomize](https://kustomize.io) introduces a template-free way to customize Kubernetes manifests. It's extensible and uses a purely declarative approach to configuration customization, which will help you efficiently manage your Infrastructure as a code (IaC).

## Overview

Kustomize works as a standalone binary; also, it's built into `kubectl` (since v1.14). It can be used with off-the-shelf applications like **Helm charts**. Also, it has a deep integration with different **GitOps** tools like ArgoCD, Flux, and many others.

## Plugins

Kustomize has 3 types of plugins `generator`, `transformer`, and `validator`.

> Note
>
> If you are a plugin developer, it's highly recommended to support the new plugins standard
> [KRM function](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/cmd/config/docs/api-conventions/functions-spec.md).

### Generators

- [Secretize](https://github.com/bbl/secretize) - Generating Kubernetes Secret from various sources. It's like a swiss army knife, but for Kubernetes secrets (Exec).
- [SopsSecretGenerator](https://github.com/goabout/kustomize-sopssecretgenerator/) - Generating Secrets from sops-encrypted files (Exec, Exec KRM).
- [KSops](https://github.com/viaduct-ai/kustomize-sops) - Generating Secrets from sops-encrypted files (Exec).
- [PolicyGenerator](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/policy-generator-plugin) - Generating Open Cluster Management policies (Exec).
- [KRMFfnBuiltin](https://github.com/kaweezle/krmfnbuiltin) - Running builtin generators transformers (Exec).
- [Merger](https://github.com/aabouzaid/kustomize-plugin-merger) - Generating manifests seamlessly by extending Kustomize merge strategies using schemaless StrategicMerge (Containerized KRM, Exec KRM).

### Transformers

- [HelmValuesTransformer](https://github.com/openinfradev/kustomize-helm-transformer) - Transforming values in HelmRelease CustomResource. It helps to manage a lot of HelmRelease's value in single transformer file (Exec).
- [TemplateTransformer](https://github.com/joshdk/template-transformer) - Providing a set of KRM Functions to run builtin transformers in place (Containerized KRM, Exec KRM).

### Validators

- [KubeconformValidator](https://github.com/aabouzaid/kustomize-kubeconformvalidator) - Validating Kubernetes manifests using embedded Kubeconform (Containerized KRM, Exec KRM).
