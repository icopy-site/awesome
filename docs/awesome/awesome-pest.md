pest is a general purpose parser written in Rust with a focus on accessibility, correctness, and performance. It uses parsing expression grammars (or [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)) as input, which are similar in spirit to regular expressions, but which offer the enhanced expressivity needed to parse complex languages.
