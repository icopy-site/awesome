Awesome Parasite [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
=========

> A curated list of amazingly awesome information and open-access databases related to parasites and host-pathogen interactions. 

Parasites are unique organisms studied in a variety of disciplines due to their health burden, diversity, and complex ecologies. 

Awesome parasite was created by [Anna Willoughby](https://arw36.github.io/) and is maintained in partnership with [EcoHealth Alliance](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/awesome-parasite/blob/master/www.ecohealthalliance.org). Contributions welcome, please read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/awesome-parasite/blob/master/contributing.md).

## Databases

 * [Olival et al. 2017](https://zenodo.org/record/807517#.Wv7kuFMvzOQ) - Mammal-virus database with [analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22975?sf90794030). 
 * [PREDICT](http://data.predict.global/) - Field data from the USAID PREDICT project 2008-2019, a global emerging virus surveillance program. This data is downloadable if you have a healthmap account. 
 * [Global Mammal Parasite Database 2.0](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.1799)- A database of the parasites of wild ungulates (artiodactyls and perissodactyls), carnivores, and primates.
 * [PEARL](http://pearl.berkeley.edu/) - Conservation assessments of macroparasitic invertebrates.
 * [Virus-Host DB](http://www.genome.jp/virushostdb/view/) - A synthesis of host-virus associations from genomes posted in NCBI/RefSeq and GenBank.
 * [NHM Host-parasite database](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/taxonomy-systematics/host-parasites/) - A database of parasitic worms maintained by London Natural History Museum. [Wells et al. 2018](http://nicholasjclark.weebly.com/uploads/4/4/9/4/44946407/wells_etal_2018_globchangbiol.pdf) provides a broad analysis of this database, and you can access data through the R package [helmithR](https://github.com/ropensci/helminthR). 
 * [Arctos](http://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenSearch.cfm) - A collective management database for museum specimens. This contains parasite samples from [Denver Museum of Nature and Science](https://www.dmns.org/science/integrative-collections/dmns-zoology-collections/), [Harold W. Manter Laboratory of Parasitology Collection](http://hwml.unl.edu/resources/database-68), [Museum of Southwestern Biology](https://msb.unm.edu/divisions/mammals/database/index.html), and the [U.S. National Parasite Collection](https://www.nal.usda.gov/exhibits/speccoll/exhibits/show/parasitic-diseases-with-econom/u-s--national-animal-parasite-). Data includes locality and collection dates, and is downloadable for any registered accounts. 
 * [ENHanCEd Infectious Diseases Database (EID2)](https://eid2.liverpool.ac.uk/) - A database that pulls organism associations from NCBI sequences and PubMed.
 * [Arbovirus Catalog (ARBOCAT)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/arbocat/) - The CDC-curated arbovirus information including dates of first isolation and wildlife hosts.
 * [Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI)](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/data.html) - A species interaction repository that can be searched by 'parasite of', 'pathogen of', or 'host of'.
 * [DBatVir](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/awesome-parasite/blob/master/www.mgc.ac.cn/DBatVir) - A bat virus database curated from Genbank with host traits and summaries by location.
 * [DRodVir](http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DRodVir/) - A rodent virus database curated from Genbank with host traits.
 * [PHI-base](http://www.phi-base.org/index.jsp) - A database with information on specific genes of fungal, Oomycete and bacterial pathogens that affect pathogenicity. Focused on agricultural and medical pathogens of importance. 

## Reporting Systems 
 * [World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS)](http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/reportarchive) - The OIE archive of country alerts and regular reports of certain pathogens. They also have some nice interfaces to show disease distribution and timelines.
 * [Healthmap](https://www.healthmap.org/en/) - A web platform that provides infectious disease outbreak alerts for humans and animals.
 * [Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMed)](http://www.promedmail.org/) - An early warning of outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging diseases. Sources of information include media reports, official reports, online summaries, local observers, and others.

## Taxonomy
 * [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) - The Taxonomy Database is a curated classification and nomenclature for all of the organisms in the public sequence databases, both parasites and hosts.
 * [ICTV](https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/) - The viral taxonomy authority with excellent archives and [open reports](https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/).
 * [IUCN Redlist](http://www.iucnredlist.org/) - Online database that provides taxonomic information for wild hosts. You can use the R package `rredlist` and the [API](http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/docs) to access the data directly. 

## Scientific Journals 
 * [Journal of Wildlife Diseases](http://www.jwildlifedis.org/loi/jwdi) - JWD provides many open-access articles on new parasite expansions or discoveries.
 * [American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene](http://www.ajtmh.org/) - AJTMH publishes a broad range of papers covering topics in tropical medicine. Their archive is open-access after a 12-month embargo.
 * [Emerging Infectious Diseases](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/) - The CDC open-access journal.
