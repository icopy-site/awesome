Awesome Parasite [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
=========

> A curated list of amazingly awesome information and open-access databases related to parasites and host-pathogen interactions. 

Parasites are unique organisms studied in a variety of disciplines due to their health burden, diversity, and complex ecologies. 

Awesome parasite was created by [Anna Willoughby](https://arw36.github.io/) and is maintained in partnership with [EcoHealth Alliance](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/awesome-parasite/blob/master/www.ecohealthalliance.org). Contributions welcome, please read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/awesome-parasite/blob/master/contributing.md).
