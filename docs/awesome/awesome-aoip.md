## Awesome Audio Over IP [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome [Audio over IP](https://www.avid.com/resource-center/audio-over-ip-avb-and-dante-what-todays-music-producer-should-know) and AES67 tools and resources.

In the professional audio sector, Audio over IP (AoIP) is about transmitting uncompressed, low-latency audio over an IP (layer 3) network. Popular examples of protocols are [Dante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_(networking)), [AES67](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES67) and [Ravenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna_(networking)).

This list is short, partly due to excluding unmaintained projects. Check out the [Footnotes](https://github.com/Mo-way/awesome-aoip/blob/master/#footnotes) section at the bottom and [awesome-but-inactive](https://github.com/Mo-way/awesome-aoip/blob/master/awesome-but-inactive.md), if you prefer a more lenient approach. In General, the AoIP ecosystem is still growing and there is rather sparse tooling available at the moment. Hence, if you find anything missing, it would delight me if you open a PR to add it.

Contributions welcome! Read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Mo-way/awesome-aoip/blob/master/contributing.md) first.

- [PTP Track Hound](https://www.ptptrackhound.com/) - PTP network traffic analysis tool (cross-platform, basic free version available).

## Organizations

- [IPMX](https://ipmx.io/about/) - A proposed set of open standards and specifications for control, copy protection, connection management and security.
- [Audinate](https://audinate.com) - Its proprietary Dante technology is the most popular AoIP solution by far.
- [Ravenna](https://www.ravenna-network.com/) - Second most popular AoIP solution, which is more open than Dante.

## Education

- [Networked Audio Products](https://rhconsulting.uk/blog/) - A census of AoIP products, conducted every year (current: [2025](https://rhconsulting.uk/blog/networked-audio-products-2025/)).
- [Dante Certification](https://www.getdante.com/resources/training/dante-certification-program/) - Understanding Dante helps to understand AoIP. The training requires an account. I recommend lv 1 and lv 2.
- [Ravenna Resources](https://www.ravenna-network.com/resources/) - Webinars and slides by Andreas Hildebrand about Ravenna, AES67, SMPTE 2110, PTP and IPMX.
- [Connecting Dante with AES67](https://download.yamaha.com/files/tcm:39-868466/) - Setting up AES67 from a Dante device isn't very straight forward, here's a guide from Yamaha as an example.

## Standards
