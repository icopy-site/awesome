## Awesome Cilium [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> Cilium is an open-source networking project that provides networking and security capabilities for containerized applications, microservices, and virtual machines.

Recently [Cilium](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable) launched a great website about eBPF called [ebpf.io](https://ebpf.io/). It serves a similar purpose to this list, with [an introduction to eBPF](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf).
