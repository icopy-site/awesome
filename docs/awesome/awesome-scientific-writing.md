## Awesome Scientific Writing [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> Scientific writing can extend beyond LaTeX, made possible by formats,
> such as
> [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (and its many flavours),
> [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) and
> [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
