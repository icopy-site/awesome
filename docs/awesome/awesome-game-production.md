## Awesome Game Production [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

[![Awesome Game Production](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vhladiienko/awesome-game-production/master/media/production_team.jpg)](https://github.com/vhladiienko/awesome-game-production)

> A curated list of **awesome** resources, related to game production process - books, articles, tools, project management, methodologies - aimed to help game producers deliver their games.

[Video game development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_development) (or production) is a process of developing a video game by a single person or a team of developers, not necessarily professionals or employed by someone to do so. This list is focused on [game producer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_producer) role - a person, who manages and orchestrates the game production process in multitude of ways. Hence the shortened list name.

This list does not cover specific disciplines like game design, quality assurance, programming. Refer to the [Gaming section](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#gaming) of the "master" awesome list for other gamedev stuff.

Majority of the provided resources are in English, but I might include items in other languages too, if you help me by [creating a pull request](https://github.com/vhladiienko/awesome-game-production/blob/main/contributing.md). Look for a flag next to the link.

### Post-mortems

Many post-mortems here are back from the day, and might seem outdated and not useful. But after reading through them you'll quickly realize the teams back then had the same issues. Use these articles as a lense to look at your problems.

- [Ensemble Studio's Age of Empires II: Age of Kings](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/postmortem-ensemble-studio-s-age-of-empires-ii-age-of-kings) - Age of Empires II: Age of Kings was developed by Ensemble Studios with the aim of improving upon the original game in every aspect, from graphics to user interface.

### Courses
- [Deeply Practical Project Management](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeply-practical-project-management/) - This is what you'd call a "no BS" course on project management. Concise, to the point, and highly practical. It is not focused on game development, but I think you should still take it, because it closes many (if not all) gaps with just one course (~9 hours). Once completed, just adapt to your needs or just use some of the principles. It also includes numerous document templates and examples.

## 🔧 Tools and templates

As a producer, you might need a few tools to help you deliver the damn thing. Some of these may not be useful to you directly, but I might have include one if I think you should at least know such a tool exists. This is to help you gain a few credits in your team.

### Tools

- [Machinations](https://machinations.io/) - A tool, that helps prototyping game mechanics, economy flow and states either for production or for demo purposes. This tool has been mentioned by Jesse Schell in his [Book of Lenses](#art-of-gd), so its old but it has transformed over the years. Not necessarily a tool for a producer to use, but it is often overlook, so go ahead and give your game designers a tip.
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) - A free and [open source](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) online drawing tool. Neither gamedev or project management related, but is so versatile, I find myself using it quite often.
- 🎓 [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - Every time you are about to Google something, I would strongly advice first to ask ChatGPT your question. We, producers, might often need to reference or look up a term or a concept, which is where ChatGPT shines.
- [GPT for Google Sheets and Docs](https://gptforwork.com/) - An awesome Google Workspace extension, that allows querying ChatGPT from within sheets or docs. You can generate data and modify any data tables or just text in any way using forumulas and functions directly in the documents.
- [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) - As they say, database of everything on Steam. Very useful to follow your competitors and compare the numbers.
- [VG Insights](https://vginsights.com/) - One of the better analytics tools and sources of estimated sales data. They also have some unique tools other similar services don't, e.g. revenue calculator, unit sales estimator and some others.
- [Steam Wishlists To Sales Calculator](https://impress.games/steam-wishlists-sales-calculator) - Simple tool to help you ballpark sales numbers based on the wishlists count on Steam. It is not as accurate, as some other tools are, but is the simplest one.

### Templates

- [GameDiscoverCo - BASIC net revenue predictions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11tNEABOKuJxX9kTLJ08DyEMf1UC3cbLdejRtmjgLBDI/edit?gid=0#gid=0) - A simple template to calculate your sales projections. As the name implies, it is very basic.

- [Altshift Steam Market Study template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tcfsNVI4x-T-Fq8gNCjiNVutB-pol2Awn6fscoZ2c-Q/edit?gid=0#gid=0) - Another template to help you analyze your competitors and calculate your potential sales numbers. Ideally, use this in combination with other templates mentioned aboe to refine your guesstimations.
- [Statistical PERT](https://www.statisticalpert.com/) - A <a name="pert"></a>set of Excel templates to help estimate and forecast a project, and hopefully make an educated decision when needed.
