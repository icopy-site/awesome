* *[HLA](http://www.plantation-productions.com/Webster/HighLevelAsm/index.html)*
>High Level Assembly (https://github.com/jaspergould/awesome-asm/blob/master/HLA) is an assembly language developed by Randall Hyde. It allows the use of higher-level language constructs to aid both beginners and advanced assembly developers. It fully supports advanced data types and object-oriented assembly language programming. It uses a syntax loosely based on several high-level languages (https://github.com/jaspergould/awesome-asm/blob/master/HLL), such as Pascal, Ada, Modula-2, and C++, to allow creating readable assembly language programs, and to allow HLL programmers to learn HLA as fast as possible.
